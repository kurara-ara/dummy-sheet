# DummySheet

A dummy-simple sheet for storing character data.
If you're constantly changing systems, and you don't have time to wait for a nice dev to implement your character sheet, then DummySheet is for you. Open it up, edit your sheet, and get to playing.

## How to use

- Edit the right columns by clicking on them.
- The `EDIT` button lets you edit the left columns, sections, and just about everything else.
- You can also change the theme by clicking on the colour boxes, if you want something cheerier.
- `EXPORT` your character to a convenient JSON file...
- ... and you can `IMPORT` it back again.
- The GM can view other players' sheets by looking through the tabs at the top.
- Have a fun time.
